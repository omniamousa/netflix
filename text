1- count the number of TV shows and movies separately and compare between them (which is more).

Start
1. Load the Netflix dataset
2. Access the 'type' column
3. Count how many times 'Movie' appears
4. Count how many times 'TV Show' appears
5. Print the count of each
6. Compare:
   - If Movie count > TV Show count → print "More Movies"
   - If TV Show count > Movie count → print "More TV Shows"
   - Else → print "Equal number of Movies and TV Shows"
End


2- iterate through the rating column of the dataset and count how many times the rating is (TV-MA).

Start
1. Load the dataset
2. Access the 'rating' column
3. Initialize a counter to 0
4. For each row in the 'rating' column:
    - If the value is 'TV-MA':
        - Increase the counter by 1
5. Print the final value of the counter as the number of TV-MA ratings
End


3- filter the dataset to only include movies released after 2015.

Start
1. Load the dataset
2. Access the 'type' and 'release_year' columns
3. Create a new dataset that includes only rows where:
    - type is 'Movie'
    - release_year is greater than 2015
4. Store the result in a new variable
5. Print or display the filtered dataset (or count the number of rows if needed)
End
